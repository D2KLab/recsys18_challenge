\section{Title2Rec}
\label{sec:t2r}
Title2Rec recommends tracks taking as input the playlist title, following the procedure illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:t2r_rec}. The title is translated into a vector $p_{t2r}$, named title embedding, computed by applying the strategy described in Section~\ref{sec:title_embs} to the playlists defined in the MPD dataset.

Given a new seed playlist, we compute its title embedding in the same way. Then, we select a subset $P$ including the top-300 most similar playlists to the given one by comparing its embeddings with $p_{t2r}$ using the cosine similarity. Finally, the required number of tracks are selected among the ones available in $P$. The tracks have been ordered to ensure that the most popular ones in $P$ are placed at the top of the list.
